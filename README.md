## EN MFlix Web application
This is an aplicattion developed during M220J MongoDB University course.
``MFlix`` allow users to list and interact with a movies catalog (any similarity with
other popular video streaming services is pure coincidence!).

In the finished version of the MFlix application, users will be able to:

- Perform movie searches with the following criteria:

  - cast members
  - genre types
  - text matches in title or description
  - country of origin

- Create faceted filters on movie searches
- Create an account and manage their preferences
- Leave comments on their favorite (or least favorite) movies

MFlix is composed of two main components:

- *Frontend*: built-in React application.

- *Backend*: *Java Spring Boot* project that provides the necessary service to
  the application. The code is managed by a Maven project.

### Technologies:
* Spring Boot
* JUnit
* React
* MongoDB
